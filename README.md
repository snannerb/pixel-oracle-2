## Project Plan
```
### Pixel Oracle Project Plan

#### **Project Goals**  
- Build a simple, retro-styled web app where users can ask questions and receive random responses based on selected categories.  
- Deliver a functional app with a clean, pixelated design and minimal user interaction.  

---

### **Project Phases**  

#### **Phase 1: Planning and Setup**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Define project scope and requirements.  
2. Choose technologies:  
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  
   - Backend: Python (Flask).  
   - Deployment: Heroku, Render, or PythonAnywhere.  
3. Set up development environment:  
   - Install Python, Flask, and necessary dependencies.  
   - Create a project directory structure.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Project plan.  
- Development environment ready.  

---

#### **Phase 2: Frontend Development**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Create the HTML structure:  
   - Title: "Pixel Oracle."  
   - Input box with placeholder: "Type your question here..."  
   - Dropdown for categories (Romance, Wealth, Career, etc.).  
   - Submit button labeled "Get Answer."  
   - Response display area.  
2. Style the app using CSS:  
   - Use a pixel font (e.g., "Press Start 2P").  
   - Set background color to grey (#808080).  
   - Apply retro, minimalistic styling.  
3. Add JavaScript functionality:  
   - Handle form submission.  
   - Send data to the backend via Fetch API.  
   - Display the response in the response area.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Functional frontend with pixelated design.  

---

#### **Phase 3: Backend Development**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Set up Flask:  
   - Create a Flask app with a route to handle requests.  
   - Define a dictionary or JSON file for category responses.  
2. Implement response generation:  
   - Use Python’s `random` module to select a random response based on the user’s category.  
3. Test backend functionality:  
   - Ensure it correctly handles requests and returns responses.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Backend API that processes requests and returns responses.  

---

#### **Phase 4: Integration and Testing**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Connect frontend and backend:  
   - Use Fetch API to send user input to the backend and display the response.  
2. Test full app functionality:  
   - Verify that the app works as expected across different categories.  
3. Debug and fix any issues.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Fully integrated and functional app.  

---

#### **Phase 5: Deployment**  
**Tasks:**  
1. Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, Render).  
2. Prepare the app for deployment:  
   - Set up `requirements.txt` for Flask.  
   - Create a `Procfile` if using Heroku.  
3. Deploy the app and test in the live environment.  

**Deliverables:**  
- Deployed Pixel Oracle app accessible via a public URL.  

---

### **Technical Considerations**  

1. **Frontend:**  
   - Use `<select>` for the category dropdown and `<input>` for the question.  
   - Apply responsive design for mobile compatibility.  
   - Use `Fetch API` for seamless backend communication.  

2. **Backend:**  
   - Use Flask for simplicity and lightweight implementation.  
   - Store responses in a dictionary or JSON file for easy updates.  
   - Use `random.choice()` to select responses.  

3. **Styling:**  
   - Ensure the pixel font is applied consistently across the app.  
   - Keep the design minimal and retro.  

4. **Deployment:**  
   - Follow platform-specific instructions for deploying Flask apps.  
   - Test the deployed app thoroughly.  

---

### **Timeline**  
- **Week 1:** Planning and setup.  
- **Week 2:** Frontend development.  
- **Week 3:** Backend development.  
- **Week 4:** Integration, testing, and deployment.  

---

### **Next Steps**  
1. Set up the development environment.  
2. Begin frontend implementation.  
3. Proceed with backend development once the frontend is ready.
